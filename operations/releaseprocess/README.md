# Release process

## Buddybuild/BitBucket integration
Whenever a build is pushed to the BitBucket repository, buddybuild will lint it, build it, and run the tests.

For the branches listed below, buddybuild will also deploy the app to iTunes Connect.

### Platform builds:
`master`, `develop`, `release/*`, `feature/*`

### App builds:
Individual `app/XXX` branches are manually configured, as they deploy to dedicated iTunes Connect accounts.

## Buddybuild deployment configuration

## Requests for submission
Requests to submit an app for Apple review should come in the following format via the corresponding app's Slack channel.  

**iOS submit for review checklist: AppName Version(BuildNumber)**  
:white_check_mark: Confirm production tests are run and app signed off  
:white_check_mark: Confirm there are no tickets not in ready for release  
:white_check_mark: Ensure submission materials provided  
:white_check_mark: Supply whatâ€™s new text  

### Sign-in information
Valid sign-in credentials should be provided for the corresponding environment if the app has sign-in functionality.

### Notes
Replace text in **bold** with corresponding values.
*Apple Music (note, you should test that the deeplink/Apple Music playlist is enabled):*  
Through the app, users may in the future have the ability to listen to Apple Music playlists natively within the app. This feature would be accessible via deep-link from a button on the menu. We have chosen to not enable this button for submission as it will be enabled at a later date. For testing purposes, you can access a playlist via the following deep-link: **ReplaceWithAppDeepLinkScheme**://applemusic/pl.u-oZylD6gsGbX9XV6  

*Colocator (only if Colocator is enabled):*  
-How does your app utilize background bluetooth-central, bluetooth-peripheral functionalities?  
These methods are referenced by the Crowd Connected Colocator iOS SDK framework, which is embedded in the app. However, due to the manner in which the App uses the Crowd Connected Colocator iOS SDK, these methods are never actually called.  

-Does this app detect startMonitoringForRegion:, startRangingBeaconsInRegion:, or both?  
Both methods are used by the embedded Crowd Connected Colocator iOS SDK framework to more accurately determine the user's current location both indoors and out, minimising the dependency on GPS. These methods are not used continually. Actual calls to these methods are determined dynamically by the Crowd Connected Colocator system so they are only used in environments where they will be beneficial.

-What is the user experience when the app detects the presence of a beacon?  
The Crowd Connected Colocator iOS SDK uses the presence of beacons to provide accurate location information. This information allows the app to target highly relevant push notifications, including emergency and safety messaging relevant to the venue/event.  

-What features in this app use background location?  
Background location is used to accurately determine the user's current position. This information allows the app to target highly relevant push notifications, including emergency and safety messaging relevant to the venue/event.  

-If this app uses 3rd party SDKs for iBeacons, please provide links to their documentation showing that background location is required for it to function.
You can find the Crowd Connected Colocator iOS SDK and its indoor positioning feature documentation at https://developers.colocator.net/sdk/ios
