# Release process

## Buddybuild/BitBucket integration
Whenever a build is pushed to the BitBucket repository, buddybuild will lint it, build it, and run the tests.

For the branches listed below, buddybuild will also deploy the app to iTunes Connect.

### Platform builds:
`master`, `develop`, `release/*`, `feature/*`

### App builds:
Individual `app/XXX` branches are manually configured, as they deploy to dedicated iTunes Connect accounts.
