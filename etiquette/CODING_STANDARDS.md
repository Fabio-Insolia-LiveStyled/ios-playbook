# Coding Standards

## Style
We follow [Ray Wenderlich's style guide](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-style-guide) to promote consistency and readability within our codebase.  
You should check it out!

## Linting
We combine the above standards with [Realm's SwiftLint tool](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint), as we know that sometimes you need a helping hand to keep things tidy.
We have a warning threshold of 6 to stop things getting out of hand!
